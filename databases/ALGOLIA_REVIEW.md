- "Pay-to-play" model for premium assistance

## Benchmarks

Performance varies based on implementation and data characteristics:
- **User Reports**: Consistently "super fast" compared to previous solutions
- **Algolia Claims**: Single-digit millisecond latency for most queries
- **Hybrid Search**: NeuralSearch™ maintains speed parity with keyword search

**⚠️ Note**: Actual performance depends on index size, query complexity, and geographic distribution.

## When to Choose Algolia

### ✅ Good Fit
- E-commerce and content discovery platforms
- Applications requiring fast, relevant search
- Teams prioritizing developer experience
- Need for rich UI components and customization
- Hybrid search requirements (keyword + semantic)

### ❌ Consider Alternatives
- Cost-sensitive applications at scale
- Need for algorithm transparency and customization
- Preference for open-source solutions
- Simple search requirements without advanced features

## Alternatives to Consider

- **Open-source**: Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, Solr
- **Vector-focused**: Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant
- **Cloud alternatives**: AWS CloudSearch, Azure Cognitive Search
- **Hybrid options**: Supabase with full-text search

## Real-World Cost Examples

### Example 1: E-commerce Product Catalog
**Scenario**: Mid-size retailer with product search
- **Records**: 100K products with variants and descriptions
- **Monthly searches**: 500K customer queries
- **Features**: Faceted search, personalization, analytics

**Monthly Cost Breakdown:**
```
Grow Tier:
- Records: 100 × $0.50 = $50.00
- Searches: 500 × $0.40 = $200.00
Total: ~$250/month
```

### Example 2: Content Discovery Platform
**Scenario**: Media company with article search
- **Records**: 1M articles, blog posts, and media content
- **Monthly searches**: 2M user queries
- **Features**: NeuralSearch™, personalization, A/B testing

**Monthly Cost Breakdown:**
```
Grow Tier:
- Records: 1,000 × $0.50 = $500.00
- Searches: 2,000 × $0.40 = $800.00
Total: ~$1,300/month

Enterprise Tier:
- Custom pricing with volume discounts
- Estimated: ~$800-1,000/month
```

### Example 3: High-Volume SaaS Application
**Scenario**: B2B platform with internal search functionality
- **Records**: 5M documents, tickets, and user data
- **Monthly searches**: 10M internal queries
- **Features**: Advanced filtering, analytics, custom ranking

**Monthly Cost Breakdown:**
```
Enterprise Required:
- Records: 5,000 × $0.50 = $2,500.00
- Searches: 10,000 × $0.40 = $4,000.00
Base estimate: ~$6,500/month

With Enterprise discounts:
- Estimated: ~$3,000-4,000/month
```

### Cost Tipping Points

| Application Type | Grow Tier Viable | Enterprise Required |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Small E-commerce** | <100K records, <1M searches | >500K records |
| **Content Platforms** | <500K records, <2M searches | >1M records |
| **SaaS Applications** | <1M records, <5M searches | >2M records |
| **High-Volume Search** | <2M searches/month | >5M searches/month |

**⚠️ Critical Insight**: Costs scale with both record count and search volume. High search volume applications (>5M/month) require enterprise contracts for viable pricing.

## Bottom Line

Algolia excels for applications requiring fast, relevant search with minimal infrastructure overhead. The platform's strength lies in its developer experience and hybrid search capabilities, but **costs can become prohibitive** at scale:

- **Sweet spot**: <1M records, <2M searches/month
- **Expensive zone**: >2M searches/month where costs exceed $1,000+/month
- **Enterprise required**: >5M searches/month for reasonable per-unit pricing

For production deployments, carefully evaluate:

1. **Search volume projections** and cost scaling implications
2. **Feature requirements** vs. available alternatives
3. **Team expertise** for implementation and optimization
4. **Long-term vendor relationship** and migration complexity

**Recommendation**: Start with Algolia for applications prioritizing speed and developer experience. **Plan cost management strategy** for high-volume scenarios and consider alternatives for price-sensitive use cases.
