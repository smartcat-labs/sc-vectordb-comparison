## Real-World Cost Examples

### Example 1: E-commerce Product Search
**Scenario**: Online retailer with 1M products, daily catalog updates
- **Vectors**: 1M product embeddings (768-dim) = ~2.9 GB storage
- **Daily writes**: 50K product updates
- **Monthly reads**: 2M customer searches
- **Metadata**: Product attributes (category, price, etc.)

**Monthly Cost Breakdown:**
```
Primary Pricing Model:
- Component 1: [calculation] = $X.XX
- Component 2: [calculation] = $X.XX
- Component 3: [calculation] = $X.XX
Total: ~$XXX/month
```

### Example 2: Large-Scale RAG Application
**Scenario**: Enterprise knowledge base with document chunks
- **Vectors**: 100M document chunks (1536-dim) = ~586 GB storage
- **Daily writes**: 1M new chunks (content updates)
- **Monthly reads**: 50M user queries
- **High metadata**: Document metadata, timestamps, permissions

**Monthly Cost Breakdown:**
```
Primary Pricing Model:
- Component 1: [calculation] = $XXX.XX
- Component 2: [calculation] = $XXX.XX
- Component 3: [calculation] = $XXX.XX
Total: ~$X,XXX/month

Alternative Pricing Model:
- Resource Type: [calculation] = $XXX.XX
- Cost: [total calculation]
```

### Example 3: Real-time Recommendation Engine
**Scenario**: Streaming platform with user behavior vectors
- **Vectors**: 10M user profiles + 1M content items (512-dim) = ~21 GB
- **High write volume**: 5M daily interactions
- **Very high reads**: 100M monthly recommendations
- **Real-time requirements**: Sub-50ms latency

**Monthly Cost Breakdown:**
```
Primary Model:
- [Detailed cost breakdown]
Total: ~$X,XXX/month

Alternative Model:
- [Comparative pricing]
Total: ~$X,XXX/month
```
